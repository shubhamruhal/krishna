           <h1>Makhan Chor</h1>
            <p>Krishna is shown carrying off one of the mischievous pranks which earned him the name makhan chor 
                (butter thief).  He has an accomplice in his older brother, Balarama, but they have been caught by
                 Yashoda and are attempting to run away.  The makhan chor stories emphasize the Hindu concept of lila,
                  playing for the sake of fun rather than for competition or advantage.</p>
